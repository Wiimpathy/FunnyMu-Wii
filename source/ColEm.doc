                           * INTRODUCTION *

  ColEm is a portable emulator of the old ColecoVision videogame console
written in C. You can always get the latest ColEm source code, binaries,
and support files from

                   http://www.komkon.org/fms/ColEm/

  There are versions of ColEm for Amiga, Macintosh, IBM PC (both MSDOS and
Windows), and other systems. Most are available from the WWW site
mentioned above.

  The ColEm source code distribution includes C sources for a portable Coleco
emulator and screen/keyboard drivers for Unix/X and MSDOS.

  If you would like to port ColEm to another system or make changes in
ColEm's code, *please*, contact me by email or some other means. Be aware
that ColEm source code is freely distributable, but it is *not* public
domain. You can not use it in commercial purposes, distribute, or change
it on your own, unless you contact me to arrange the conditions of such
usage and get my permission. Feel free to look at existing drivers as well
as at other code.

  Finally, I would like to thank:

  Hans Guijt [.NL]         Neal Danner [.US]
  Marcel de Kogel [.NL]    Alan Steremberg [.US]
  John Stiles [.US]

...and to all people who helped me with advices, information, ROM images,
and encouragment.

                       * SOUNDTRACK FILE FORMAT *
                        
  ColEm is capable of saving soundtrack into so-called .SND files, also
used by my other emulators. You can find tools to work with these files in
the EMUTools package. .SND files have quite simple format described below:

Byte     Contents
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0-3      String "SND^Z"
4        Version number
5        Number of channels
6        Clock frequency, in Hz
7-15     Reserved, must be zeroes!
16-EOF   Sound records of following types:

         a) channel# | frequency.l | frequency.h | volume
            Change sound on a given channel to new frequency (Hz)
            and volume (0..255).
                       
         b) FFh         
            A single clock "tick".

         c) FDh | number of ticks
            Multiple clock "ticks" (0..255).

         d) FEh | channel# | sound type
            Change sound type at a given channel. Default type
            is MELODIC for all channels. Currently defined types:

            0 - MELODIC
            1 - WHITE NOISE
            2 - PERIODIC NOISE

                     * FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS *

* I WANNA PLAY GAMES!!!! WHERE DO I GET GAMES???????
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I do not know. I can't give you any due to both legal and moral reasons.
Please, do not mail me asking for games. I will delete your mail right
away, and you won't get an answer.
         
* How do I copy games from cartridges to a computer?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You can use a special device called cartridge copier. Pascal Felber has
made such a copier. Its schematics and software are available at

                http://lsewww.epfl.ch/~felber/IO-56/
  
  You can also buy this copier from Pascal, either in parts, or as a  
pre-built kit.
         
* Why is ColEm so slow on my PC?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Because your machine is too slow to run it. My experience shows that you
need at least a 486DX/33 machine with fast video to run emulation at a
reasonable speed. Following are the ways to speeds thing up: 
     
  a) Increase UPeriod. The picture gets more jerky this way, but the
     program become faster.

  b) Decrease VPeriod. While it may prevent some games from working,
     others will run faster.

  c) On Unix, always use MIT Shared Memory Extension for X (MITSHM). This,
     of course, means that you have to run program locally.

* ColEm is too fast on my machine! How do I slow it down?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Decrease UPeriod to 2 or even to 1. The emulation will become much   
slower, but smoother. You can also increase VPeriod to make games run
slower.

* ColEm starts, but then it exits immediately.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This may happen because of following problems:

  a) Check if you have the COLECO.ROM file in the current directory. This
     ROM contains ColecoVision startup code and BIOS. It must be 8192
     bytes long. ColEm won't run without it.

  b) Check your cartridge ROM image size: it must be a multiple of 8192.
     Otherwise, your ROM is most likely corrupted.

  c) Look at the cartridge ROM image in the editor: the first two bytes
     must be AAh 55h or 55h AAh.

* My favorite game doesn't work on ColEm. What do I do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  There may be several reasons why a game has problems running on ColEm
or does not run at all:

  a) If the game hangs, it may be because the VPeriod is too small.
     Increase the VPeriod and see what happens.

  b) The game may require some exotic piece of equipment, such as a
     light gun. Not all ColecoVision addons are supported by ColEm.

  c) ColEm may not currently run this game. Not all games are supported at
     this moment. Don't expect 100% compatibility with real hardware.

* Is it legal to spread cartridge ROMs?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NO. Few people seem to care though, mainly because there is no profit to
be made on these ROMs any longer. Nevertheless, be aware of the fact that
by using commercial software you haven't bought, you are commencing an act
of piracy. Many ColecoVision games belong to a company called Telegames
now, which doesn't take spreading their ROM images lightly.

* What should I do to convert .SND files saved by ColEm into music?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  An .SND file is a soundtrack saved by ColEm. You can play it using
PSGPLAY program included into EMUTools package. You can also convert .SND
files into MIDI format (.MID) using the SND2MID utility. SND2MID is also
included into EMUTools.

* What is that EMUTools package and where do I get it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  EMUTools is a set of utilities which may be useful for both emulator
authors and users. They allow to list and verify diferent ROM images,
convert music files, disassemble and compare ROMs. EMUTools can be
obtained from ColEm WWW site.

* Do I need to unpack GZIPped ROM images to run them on ColEm?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  No, unless your copy of ColEm has been compiled without #define ZLIB. 
It allows ColEm to recognize and automatically unpack GZIPped and singular
PKZIPped files. To find out whether your ColEm supports this feature, run
it with -help option and see if there is anything said about GZIP support. 

* When starting ColEm-Unix, I get X_ShmAttach error.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  You are probably trying to run ColEm-Unix on a remote Xterminal while it
attempts to use shared memory for interfacing with X. Use -noshm option to
tell it not to use shared memory.
  
* When starting ColEm-Unix, I get X_PutImage error.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ColEm-Unix version currently needs 8bit, 16bit, or 24bit X. Neither
2-color nor 16-color Xterminals will work.

* I start ColEm-Unix, but the window stays black.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Some other X application took over all available colors so that the
emulation could not allocate any for itself. Check if you run XV,
Netscape, or something similar.

* When compiling emulator under Unix, I get "undefined name" errors.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This means that your linker can not find the libraries necessary for the
emulator (namely, libX11.a and libXext.a) or some additional libraries
(like libsocket.a and libnsl.a) are required. Find these libraries in your
system and modify the Makefile so that the final invocation of the C
compiler has "-L<path_to_libs>" options. If you have no libXext.a library,
try #undefining MITSHM option.
