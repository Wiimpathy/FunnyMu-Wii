Funvision FAQ
=============

Q. How do I resize the window?

A. You don't


Q. The game starts in demo mode but I can't do anything

A. Most games seem to go into demo mode immediately after they start. To 
   start a game you usally press the emulators RESET button (which is mapped
   to the ESC key). Then you typically select a level using the fire buttons.
   Which are currently the shift keys, left control and the tab key. Then to
   start the game you usually press a key (I find M or Z are good candidates).


Q. The sound in the Windows version is awful

A. Sound works fine under Linux. Its something to do with how SDL does
   sound under Windows.


Q. Sonic Invaders makes a high pitched noise all the way through.

A. Yeah it does that doesn't it.


Q. Where do I find ROMs?

A. I have no idea. I have even less idea if you ask me personally.


Q. These games are crap. Your emulator stinks.

A. Thats nice dear.


Q. I can't compile it. It always gives me errors.

A. Do you have gcc installed? Do you have SDL installed? 


Q. It runs too slow on my 386.

A. Yes it does. I've been running it on my P133 at OK speeds. I am guessing 
   that a P200 would probably run everything at full Funvision speed.
